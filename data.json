"Description":"The Challenger is one big bruiser, 
with heft better suited to cruising or drag-racing at the strip than turning laps on a racetrack. Powertrains include 
the standard 305-hp 3.6-liter V-6 and an eight-speed automatic; one 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 makes 375 hp with the standard 
six-speed manual, and one (with fuel-saving tech) makes 372 hp with the optional eight-speed auto. The Scat Pack option 
features a 485-hp 6.4-liter Hemi V-8; a six-speed manual is standard and an eight-speed auto is optional."
